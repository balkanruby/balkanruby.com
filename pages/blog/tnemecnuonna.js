              Hello, I'm Genadi and those are my friends – Vestimir, Svetlio &
              Svetlio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we have been searching for that perfect object that
              encapsulates the things we love — the Balkans and Ruby. We tried
              in the yellow pages, but nope. Nothing there. We searched this
              thing called the internet, and holy shit! What is this thing
              filled with? Cats and crypto currencies? Heck, we even tried
              outside, alas to no avail.
            </p>
            <p>
              This quest... it left us a bit empty. So we dug. We dug deep into
              the intelligible realm of them forms and there it was! Right in
              front of us, it stood as this majestic monolith. Oh, and it was
              beautiful! All those people bringing their laughter, and infinite
              knowledge. Everybody had read the code of conduct and was actually
              nice. Forget twitter and youtube comments. It was heaven! All of
              it was in the Balkans. It looked like Sofia, Bulgaria, but yet, it
              wasn't. We had to take it out of this perfect space. We had to!
            </p>
            <p>
              When we travel, I always try to bring my proton pack. "You never
              know when you'll need one" I say, but the guys — they always
              complain. "You bring too much luggage" they say. But did they wish
              to have one right now... And of course they did! We were in the
              perfect realm of them forms, after all. They just had to imagine
              it. I always bring too much luggage...
            </p>
            <p>
              Charging them up, the sound reminded me of an old rusty hard-drive
              defragging a 10G FAT32 partition. Even here, the proton packs
              looked like they came out of an 80's classic movie. After a round
              of belot, a few curses and almost a fight later, the guns charged.
              We decided to cross streams. It was the only way. We had to!
            </p>
            <p>
              There we were, crossing streams of radially polarized protons,
              holding on to our existence. The side effects could have been
              severe, but we managed to get away without any mutations. And boy,
              oh boy — did all this hard work payed off! Here, we have it in the
              plain old boring object space. Immutable, like the perfect string!

              Ladies and gentlemen, let me present Balkan Ruby to you. A brand
              new Ruby conference to be held on 25th and 26th of May, 2018, in
              Sofia, Bulgaria. We want to share this meta moment with all of
              you! We have a call for papyrus open and we welcome every little
              crazy idea you have. Don't be shy!
            </p>
